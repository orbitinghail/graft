## What is Graft?

Graft is a transactional blob storage engine supporting lazy partial replication to the edge. It's optimized for scale and cost over latency and leverages object storage for durability.

## Key Features

- **Asynchronous replication** to object storage
- **Stateless lazy partial replicas** on the edge and in devices
- **Serializable snapshot isolation**
- **Point in time restore**

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started with Graft is through the [SQLite Extension](/sqlite/), which allows you to use Graft with SQLite databases.
